"""Derive and qualify a worker lifecycle from the resource cost of the task assigned.

The canonical model already exists. `SDK-TT-PURPOSE-BOUND-WORKER-RUNTIME-PROOF-001` states
it as an invariant:

    WORKER_LIFETIME_IS_DERIVED_PER_INTENDED_TASK_NOT_GLOBALLY_FIXED

and gives the derivation as five resource-cost components that sum to the lifetime:

    expected_task_execution          6
    known_delay                      4
    inferred_unknown_delay_reserve   8
    records_decomposition            7
    safety_reserve                   5
                                  = 30 seconds

with production requiring `recompute_per_task`, `cost_analysis_required`,
`early_retirement_on_purpose_completion`, and
`budget_extension_requires_new_governed_recalculation`.

`purpose_bound_worker_cost_demo._sum_budget` already implements exactly that sum. So the
formula is not missing and this module does not invent one.

What is missing is the input. The chain is: **task -> estimated resource cost -> worker
lifecycle**, and the estimate belongs on the task. Measured across the 163 canonical task
records, exactly one carries a resource cost estimate, one carries a lifetime model, and
one carries a cost_basis_ref -- the same record, whose purpose is to prove the model. The
other 162 assign work whose worker lifetime nothing derives.

That matters because the lifecycle is what governance and record keeping bind to: the
expiry is the window in which a worker may act, and therefore the window its receipts
cover. A task with no resource estimate produces a window nobody can check.

Deterministic and offline: no I/O, no account state, no network.
